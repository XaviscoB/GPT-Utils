# GPT-Utils
Crazy ideas using ChatGPT
English Version of README

# ðŸ’¡ What is the purpose of this repository?

> The repository was created to save/capture crazy or useful inventions made using ChatGPT as a base or implementation. Since the API provided by OpenAI is paid, I often use and abuse the [OpenGPT](https://github.com/uesleibros/OpenGPT) library, which provides several APIs that make ChatGPT available for free

# ðŸ“– Projects currently contained within the Repository

- [x] MovieScraper (Working)
> Its main function would be to extract torrent links, which would be Magnet Links from a pirate site. Its goal is simply to automate my task of adding movies every day on a Discord server.

# ðŸ“š Projects to be added

- [ ] AutoGPT but without OpenAI API
> I was intrigued by this new Auto-GPT technology, so I modified some files and replaced the OpenAI API with my own, to be honest, one of the ones offered by [OpenGPT](https://github.com/uesleibros/OpenGPT). I have to polish and format it for publishing, but it will be released soon.

- [ ] Integrate ANY Chat Model in LangChain
> Unfortunately, LangChain only has paid models and limited integration and usage for its Framework, so I modified its files to allow for any integration to be added.

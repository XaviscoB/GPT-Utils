# Unfinished Models

This folder contains models that are still in development or require further improvements. The models in this folder may contain bugs or not yet produce satisfactory results.

## Purpose

The purpose of this folder is to separate the unfinished models from the completed ones. This helps to keep the repository organized and makes it easier for users to find working models. Additionally, by keeping the unfinished models separate, developers can avoid confusing users with models that are not yet ready for use.

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute to any of the models in this folder, feel free to do so. Please keep in mind that these models are not yet completed and may require additional work. Before contributing, it may be helpful to communicate with the original author of the model to ensure that your changes align with their goals.

## Disclaimer

The models in this folder are not guaranteed to produce accurate results and may contain bugs. It is possible that one of them gives host errors, json bugs or badly formatted code.
